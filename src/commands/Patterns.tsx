      <p>Key patterns for transition:</p>
      <ul className="ml-4 space-y-2">
        <li className="text-cyan-400">
          1. Mutual Benefit Circuits <span className="text-gray-500">(Type 'mutual' to expand)</span>
          {expandedSection === 'mutual-benefit' && (
            <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-emerald-400">
              <p>
                These are networks where all participants benefit from the interactions and transactions. In Game-B, mutual benefit circuits can be seen in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms where users earn rewards for liquidity provision, governance, and other activities.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-gray-800 p-3 mt-2 rounded border border-emerald-700">
                <p className="text-cyan-400">
                  <em>Example:</em> In Game-B, a DeFi platform might use a token that rewards users for staking and participating in the network, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and prosperity.
                </p>

          2. Anti-Fragile Systems <span className="text-gray-500">(Type 'fragile' to expand)</span>
          {expandedSection === 'anti-fragile' && (
            <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-emerald-400">
              <p>
                Anti-fragile systems not only withstand shocks but also improve from them. In the context of Game-B, this means designing systems that learn and adapt to change, becoming stronger over time.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-gray-800 p-3 mt-2 rounded border border-emerald-700">
                <p className="text-cyan-400">
                  <em>Example:</em> A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in Game-B could use machine learning algorithms to improve its decision-making processes based on feedback and data from its members and the environment.
                </p>
              </div>

            <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-emerald-400">
              <p>
                Distributed governance involves decision-making processes that are decentralized and participatory. In Game-B, this can be achieved through blockchain-based voting mechanisms and community-driven initiatives.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-gray-800 p-3 mt-2 rounded border border-emerald-700">
                <p className="text-cyan-400">
                  <em>Example:</em> A community in Game-B could use a blockchain-based voting system to decide on the allocation of resources, ensuring that everyone has a say in the decision-making process.
                </p>
              </div>

            <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-emerald-400">
              <p>
                Sense-making networks are platforms where individuals and groups can share information, insights, and knowledge to create a coherent understanding of complex systems. In Game-B, these networks can facilitate collaboration and innovation.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-gray-800 p-3 mt-2 rounded border border-emerald-700">
                <p className="text-cyan-400">
                  <em>Example:</em> A knowledge-sharing platform in Game-B could connect experts and enthusiasts from various fields, enabling them to collaborate on solving global challenges related to the metacrisis.
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                Generative commons are shared resources that are created and maintained by communities. In Game-B, this can include open-source software, collaborative research projects, and shared infrastructure.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-gray-800 p-3 mt-2 rounded border border-emerald-700">
                <p className="text-cyan-400">
                  <em>Example:</em> An open-source project in Game-B could be a decentralized application (dApp) that provides tools and resources for individuals and organizations to address the metacrisis, fostering collaboration and innovation.
